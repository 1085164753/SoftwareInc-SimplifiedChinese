# Software Inc. Chinese Translate

I need tell you true, "Software Inc." is a Video Game.

简体中文用户请查看 [汉语说明](README_CN.md)

## Translate Status

Tested in `Alpha Steam 5.4, OSXPlayer`

* [ ] UI.xml
	* [x] All user interface's Title/Main Button name/Main Button Description
	* [ ] All stuff
* [ ] Furniture.xml
	* [x] All furniture's name
	* [ ] All furniture's description
* [x] Software.xml
	* [x] All software creation options name
	* [x] All software creation options description

Is something missed? Yes, not all string got listed in files.

So when i finish this translate i'll send mail to game's developer to request more translatable string.
